# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Insights

**Domain: Hospitality**       **Function: Revenue Department**

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.


**Task:**  

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.

2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

Concepts learnt from this project:

1. Various hospitality metrics and how it effects the other, gained valuable info about the hospitality domain and how the industry functions in the real world.
2. Context of these metrics and how can a data analyst percieve this info and apply his expertise.
3. Learnt how to create a scroll toggle button to save some space in my laptop dashboard. (Refer City-wise report)

4. Learnt how to create a tooltip visual on the new card visual update from Power BI, also because of the project I am well equipped with the new card visual.

   ![Card visual](https://github.com/JoysonPrince/AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Insights/assets/137388224/b6c5b3d8-529c-45f0-aba1-65b8295f7f42)
5. Utilized bookmarks functionality to switch the table visual with all its metrics for top-2 and bottom-2 performing cities. (Refer City-wise report)
   This is the extended and a pre-cursor to step 3.

   ![Toggle visual](https://github.com/JoysonPrince/AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Insights/assets/137388224/c4dfd025-5766-4061-a46a-836ec385d57b)

   As you can see from the visual above, by default the toggle is switched off, which displays the performance metrics for top-2 cities, and when the user scrolls the toggle 
   on, they will see the performance metrics for bottom-2 cities.
